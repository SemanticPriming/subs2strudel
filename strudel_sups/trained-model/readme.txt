The baked-strudel file in this directory is a text file that contains the "Baked Strudel" model we used for all experiments in the Strudel paper.

Each line of the file is in format

concept property log-likelihood-ratio (gentype count prop)+

where gentype is a generalized type, count is the number of times the type connects concept and property and prop is the proportion of the type in the overall type sketch distribution of the concept-property pair. This file only contains types that account for at least 10% of the overall type distribution. We can provide a larger file with all types upon request.
