This directory contains 2 Perl scripts that are used for the pattern extraction and generalization steps of the Strudel algorithm.

Once you make them executable, you can see the usage information of the scripts by calling them with the -h option.

All other parts of the Strudel procedure are implemented using Unix command line tools and the following free software:

- The IMS Open Corpus WorkBench, used to index the input corpus:
  http://cwb.sourceforge.net/

- The UCS toolkit, used to compute the log-likelihood ratio statistic:
